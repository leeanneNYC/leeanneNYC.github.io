    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>
      Topshop started as a brand extension of the department store Peter Robinson in the 1960s and originally sold fashion by young British designers, such as Mary Quant and Stirling Cooper. Peter Robinson was a women's fashion chain that had been acquired by Burton in 1946.[6] Topshop was founded in 1964 as Peter Robinson's Top Shop, a youth brand within the Sheffield branch and also had a large department in the Oxford Street store. This was high fashion for the "young and different generation" as The Times put it in 1965, and the department stocked garments by names such as Mary Quant and Gerald McCann. By 1966, it had a branch in the Peter Robinson store in Norwich.

      <br><br>
      Peter Robinson's Top Shop buyer Diane Wadey had an eye for young talent and introduced Royal College of Art graduate Jane Whiteside to Jeff Cooper and Ronnie Stirling – the Stirling Cooper brand they created soon had its own sections in Top Shop stores in London and Sheffield, as well as being stocked in Peter Robinson stores in Norwich and Bristol. Other brands stocked at Top Shop included Jeff Banks, French Connection and Radley Cooper.

    <p>In the 1980s, Topshop struggled to maintain its profile as a fashion brand, but by the late 1990s it began undergoing a revival.[21] This turnaround is often credited to the promotion of Jane Shepherdson as brand director.[22] Having begun her career as a buyer, she rose through the ranks at the company. When she took on brand direction, Topshop had an annual profit of £9 million; by 2005 it was making over £100 million annually. </p><br><br>

Under her tenure, Topshop became a key sponsor of London Fashion Week, sponsoring its Newgen arm that supports emerging British designers from 2002 and the Fashion East initiative – which acts as a bridge between London's fashion colleges and the Newgen scheme – a year later. This sponsorship continues and since 2005 it has been part of the London Fashion Week catwalk schedule. </p><br>

<p>As of 2012, it is part-owned by a US-based private equity group.

In 2015, Topshop started collaborating with the online retailer Zalando and began selling their merchandise in the stores. Advertisements featuring model Cara Delevingne were broadcast in Germany, Switzerland and France.  </p>

    <p class="pullquote">
      Topshop has around 510 shops including those that are franchised; over 300 stores are located in the UK. It operates across 37 countries and via online operations in a number of markets.

    <p>In December 2012, Philip Green sold a 25% stake in Topshop and Topman to the US-based private equity group Leonard Green and Partners for US$805 million. Under the terms of the deal, Arcadia retained Topshop's flagship Oxford Street store (said to be worth between £400 and £500 million). Green said that the deal would enable Topshop to speed up its expansion, particularly within the US.</p><br><br>

    <h4>International Operations</h4>

    <p>Topshop began planning its expansion to the US in the mid-2000s and was tipped to open in New York as early as 2007. Currently it operates via a website and sells in Nordstrom stores. A small number of wholly owned stores are located in major cities, with more store openings planned. On 5 November 2014 it opened a flagship store in New York City, located on Fifth Avenue. The store is the largest international site, and second only to the Oxford Street, London store in square footage. This is its second store in New York City, the first having opened on Broadway in 2009.</p><br><br>

    <p>Topshop announced a five-year international expansion plan in early 2011, planning to open new shops across Asia, Australia and the US as well as seeking opportunities in Europe. Although the Japanese flagship stores launched in 2006, all 5 stores in Japan shut in 2015. In 2013, parent group Arcadia began stepping up its franchise deals, announcing a planned 150 new store openings with partners in Canada, Australia and Vietnam, to include Topshop and Topman stores.</p> <br><br>
