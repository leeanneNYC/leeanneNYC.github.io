    <h3>Zara (Spanish: [ˈθaɾa]) is a Galician fast fashion (clothing and accessories) retailer based in Arteixo, Galicia (Spain). The company was founded in 1975 by Amancio Ortega and Rosalía Mera. It is the main brand of the Inditex group, the world's largest apparel retailer. The fashion group also owns brands such as Massimo Dutti, Pull&Bear, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home, and Uterqüe. Zara as of 2017 manages up to 20 clothing collections a year.</h3> <br><br>

    <h4>History</h4>

    <p>Amancio Ortega opened the first Zara store in 1975 in downtown A Coruña, Galicia, Spain. Ortega initially named the store Zorba after the classic film Zorba the Greek, but after learning there was a bar with the same name two blocks away, they rearranged the letters molded for the sign to 'Zara.' It is believed the extra 'a' came from an additional set of letters that had been made for the company. The first store featured low-priced lookalike products of popular, higher-end clothing fashions. Ortega opened additional stores throughout Spain. During the 1980s, Ortega changed the design, manufacturing, and distribution process to reduce lead times and react to new trends in a quicker way, which he called "instant fashions". The improvements included the use of information technologies and using groups of designers instead of individuals.</p>

    <p class="pullquote">In 2015, Zara was ranked 30 on Interbrand's list of best global brands.</p>

    <p> Zara introduced the use of RFID technology in its stores in 2014. The RFID chips are located in the security tags which are removed from clothing when it is purchased and can be reused. The chip allows the company to quickly take inventory by detecting radio signals from the RFID tags. When an item is sold, the stockroom is immediately notified so that the item can be replaced. An item that is not on the shelf can easily be found with the RFID tag.</p><br><br>


    <h4>Manufacturing & Distribution</h4>

    <p>Zara stores have men's and women's clothing, as well as children's clothing (Zara Kids). Zara's products are supplied based on consumer trends. Its highly responsive supply chain ships new products to stores twice a week. After products are designed, they take ten to fifteen days to reach the stores. All of the clothing is processed through the distribution center in Spain. New items are inspected, sorted, tagged, and loaded into trucks. In most cases, the clothing is delivered within 48 hours.</p>

    <p class="pullquote">Zara produces over 450 million items per year.</p>

    <p>Reportedly, Zara needs just one week to develop a new product and get it to stores, compared to the six-month industry average, and launches around 12,000 new designs each year. Zara has a policy of zero advertising;[6] the company preferred to invest a percentage of revenues in opening new stores instead.</p><br><br>

    <p>Zara set up its own factory in La Coruña (a city known for its textile industry) in 1980, and upgraded to reverse milk-run-type production and distribution facilities in 1990. This approach, designed by Toyota Motor Corp., was called the just-in-time (JIT) system. It enabled the company to establish a business model that allows self-containment throughout the stages of materials, manufacture, product completion and distribution to stores worldwide within just a few days.</p><br><br>

    <p>Most of the products Zara sells are manufactured in proximity countries like Spain, Portugal, Turkey and Morocco.While some competitors outsource all production to Asia, Zara manufactures its most fashionable items—half of all its merchandise—at a dozen company-owned factories in Spain and Portugal and Turkey, particularly in Galicia and northern Portugal and Turkey. Clothes with a longer shelf life, such as basic T-shirts, are outsourced to low-cost suppliers, mainly in Asia.</p><br><br>

     <h4>Net Sales Increase</h4>

    <p>The popular fast-fashion brand's parent company, Inditex, reported strong earnings for the first half of the year, including a 17% increase in net sales and a 7% increase in same store sales.

<p>One reason for Zara's continual surge might be social media.</p> <br>

<p>Traditional retailers have paled in comparison to fast fashion giants Zara, and even its competitor H&M - in part because of social media outlets, like Instagram.</p> <br>

<p>"Back in the '80s and '90s, there wasn't real access to higher-level fashion," Kate Davidson Hudson, co-founder and chief executive of Editorialist, said to The New York Times earlier this year.</p> <br>

<p class="pullquote">"But now, everybody sees what's on the runways on social media and on blogs, and everybody's a critic, and shoppers want it as soon as they see it"</p> 

<p>But brands like Zara do not.</p> <br><br>

<p>Zara's unique and highly successful business model keeps the brand's fashion-conscious consumers coming back for more.</p> <br><br>

<p>"Unlike fast fashion retailers which have buying teams sourcing current trending fashion from third-party vendors, traditional specialty retailers have design teams creating product they believe is going to be trending 12-months out," Goldman Sachs researchers wrote.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Fast fashion brands are able to keep their prices low by relying on streamlined supply chains, globally integrated guidelines and policies as well as a quick implementation process.
</p> <br><br>

<p>If we use Zara as a case study, we can definitely see this quick implementation process in the brand’s logistic operations. Zara is known for being able to create a new design and have the finished product (based on said design) shipped to all 2,213 stores in just two short weeks. In these two weeks, Zara is able to design, produce, market and distribute a brand new item that reaches all 93 countries that the clothing giant operates in. This ridiculous efficiency has given an edge to fast fashion companies that traditional retailers will always struggle to mirror. Never before has clothing been mass produced in such an economical format. This method of conducting business is extremely valuable in this fashion industry as many experts believe we no longer follow a four-season fashion calendar, but rather we are in the 52 micro-seasons of fashion.</p> <br><br>

<p class="pullquote"> Zara can create a new design and have the finished product shipped to all 2,213 stores in just two weeks. </p> <br>

<p>But getting products designed and distributed quickly is not the only trick that fast fashion retailers have in their arsenal. They are also well-known for keeping very limited stock on all their items. This is done because it preserves the ability for companies to make impromptu stock orders, which benefit retailers by allowing them to adjust inventory based on changes in consumer interest. This works amazingly in the world of fashion because with every passing day comes another #OOTD (outfit of the week). In the case of Zara, the clothing giant makes it a priority to stay connected with the latest trends and style formats; thus products are imported in low stock at an alarming twice-a-week schedule.
