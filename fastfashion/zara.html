    <p>The popular fast-fashion brand's parent company, Inditex, reported strong earnings for the first half of the year, including a 17% increase in net sales and a 7% increase in same store sales.

<p>One reason for Zara's continual surge might be social media.</p> <br>

<p>Traditional retailers have paled in comparison to fast fashion giants Zara, and even its competitor H&M - in part because of social media outlets, like Instagram.</p> <br>

<p>"Back in the '80s and '90s, there wasn't real access to higher-level fashion," Kate Davidson Hudson, co-founder and chief executive of Editorialist, said to The New York Times earlier this year.</p> <br>

<p class="pullquote">"But now, everybody sees what's on the runways on social media and on blogs, and everybody's a critic, and shoppers want it as soon as they see it," she added. "Brands like Gap just feel very dated."</p> 

<h4>But brands like Zara do not.</h4> <br>
