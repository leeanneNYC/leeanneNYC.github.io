    <h1>How Social Media Contributed to the Rise of Fast Fashion</h1>
    <h3>Opinion: Most people can’t afford to buy a high-end item and only wear it once</h3>
    <p>
      When you look at how social media is a part of our lives today, it’s hard to recall life without it. Everywhere you go, someone around you is on their phone engaging with some sort of social platform. And while some people use social media to share content, some people just use social media to see what their friends are doing.

      According to Jeff Goins, author of The Art of Work, there are two types of social media users: “sprinklers” and “vacuums.” The sprinklers of social media share content, and the vacuums suck it all up. It’s in a way like the food chain, one can’t exist without the other.
