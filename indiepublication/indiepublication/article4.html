      Visual content has made H&M, Topshop/Topman Forever21 the most successful social media brands in the competitive fast-fashion industry. <br> <br>
      This was according to data from visual content performance platform ShareIQ. The analysis digs into the data for the first three quarters of 2017 among the top brands in the fast-fashion category in the United States: H&M, Forever21, Uniqlo, Gap, Old Navy, Topshop/Topman, Zara, Mango and American Apparel.<br><br>

      Brands are sharing visual content on social media platforms in hopes of better engaging customers on Pinterest, Instagram and across the web. H&M has 974 engagements per image (EPI), about 20 times the content performance of the lowest-performing brands, such as Mango (52 EPI), Gap (48 EPI) and American Apparel (41 EPI). Also topping the list are Topshop/Topman with 596 EPI, Forever21 (397 EPI), Zara (190 EPI) and Uniqlo (161 EPI). Old Navy trailed with 70 EPI. <br><br>

      When it comes to visual content, imagery with varied backgrounds is more engaged with than “static” lookbook-style photos. Meanwhile, brands with smart seeding strategies see a greater return on their visual content investment. Among the winners in this strategy are:

    <h3 class="list">• Forever21, with a tremendous 53 million Instagram engagements from just 1,017 posts. <br><br>

      • H&M achieved 39 million Instagram engagements from only 486 posts. <br><br>

      • Zara got just 1.9 million engagements from 1,700 images. <br><br>

      • The tale was different on Pinterest, with Zara getting more than five times the number of repins (shares) per image as Forever21.
