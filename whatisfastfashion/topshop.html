    </h1></a>

    <h3 class="definition">Topshop (originally Top Shop) is a British multinational fashion retailer of clothing, shoes, make-up and accessories. It has around 500 shops worldwide – of which some 300 are in the UK – plus online operations in a number of its markets. Its current CEO is Ian Grabiner, and it is part of the Arcadia Group, which is controlled by Sir Philip Green.</h3>

    <h3 class="history">History</h3>

    <p>
      Topshop started as a brand extension of the department store Peter Robinson in the 1960s and originally sold fashion by young British designers, such as Mary Quant and Stirling Cooper. Peter Robinson was a women's fashion chain that had been acquired by Burton in 1946.[6] Topshop was founded in 1964 as Peter Robinson's Top Shop, a youth brand within the Sheffield branch and also had a large department in the Oxford Street store. This was high fashion for the "young and different generation" as The Times put it in 1965, and the department stocked garments by names such as Mary Quant and Gerald McCann. By 1966, it had a branch in the Peter Robinson store in Norwich.

      <br><br>
      Peter Robinson's Top Shop buyer Diane Wadey had an eye for young talent and introduced Royal College of Art graduate Jane Whiteside to Jeff Cooper and Ronnie Stirling – the Stirling Cooper brand they created soon had its own sections in Top Shop stores in London and Sheffield, as well as being stocked in Peter Robinson stores in Norwich and Bristol. Other brands stocked at Top Shop included Jeff Banks, French Connection and Radley Cooper.

      The aspirational nature of Instagram makes us all the more vulnerable to clever marketing ploys while scrolling through our feeds.

     <p> There is no denying that we live in a fast-paced, instant gratification world today. And, while Instagram can’t be solely blamed for this, it has certainly had a big impact. Because this is a domain in which the numbers game reigns supreme and it’s not uncommon for photos to be deleted if they don’t garner enough ‘likes’ within the first thirty minutes. But is this normalisation of a need for speed mentality also having a flow-on effect when it comes to our consumption habits as well? I would argue that the rapid rise of click-to-purchase within the app is certainly evidence that this is the case, not to mention the popularity of fast fashion clothing today. Because, just like Instagram, Zara and H&M have cultivated their business models based on speed.

      As one of fashion’s most important social platforms, Instagram has impacted more than just the way we view clothes; it has also upended the system as a whole. According to Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, Instagram is “by far the most relevant social platform for luxury brands.” And, looking at the recent changes to the traditional fashion calendar, it’s clear that the app’s focus on speed has now extended to the fashion calendar as well. This is a calendar that once comprised two collections per year and now comprises a norm of six and as many as 52 micro-seasons per year. "Logistically looking at the fashion-show construct, it makes very little sense now," explains Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman.
