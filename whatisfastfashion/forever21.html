    <h3>by: Rosie Dalton</h3>

    <p>
      According to a recent report by Deloitte, 47% of Millennials say that social media influences their purchase decisions. And given that Business of Fashion counts Instagram as the key platform for fashion businesses, we can’t help but wonder if the instantaneous photo-sharing app might also be fuelling our fast fashion habit as well. Certainly it has helped to normalise a new level of speed, while shifting the traditional fashion calendar in the process. And meanwhile, the aspirational nature of Instagram makes us all the more vulnerable to clever marketing ploys while scrolling through our feeds. In this way, the supposedly democratic platform can obscure the real faces behind our clothing and trick us into wanting what we don’t need. So, as we double tap that latest picture of Bella Hadid wearing some fast fashion brand or other, are we really aware of the hidden messages behind this (likely sponsored) content?

     <p> There is no denying that we live in a fast-paced, instant gratification world today. And, while Instagram can’t be solely blamed for this, it has certainly had a big impact. Because this is a domain in which the numbers game reigns supreme and it’s not uncommon for photos to be deleted if they don’t garner enough ‘likes’ within the first thirty minutes. But is this normalisation of a need for speed mentality also having a flow-on effect when it comes to our consumption habits as well? I would argue that the rapid rise of click-to-purchase within the app is certainly evidence that this is the case, not to mention the popularity of fast fashion clothing today. Because, just like Instagram, Zara and H&M have cultivated their business models based on speed.

      As one of fashion’s most important social platforms, Instagram has impacted more than just the way we view clothes; it has also upended the system as a whole. According to Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, Instagram is “by far the most relevant social platform for luxury brands.” And, looking at the recent changes to the traditional fashion calendar, it’s clear that the app’s focus on speed has now extended to the fashion calendar as well. This is a calendar that once comprised two collections per year and now comprises a norm of six and as many as 52 micro-seasons per year. "Logistically looking at the fashion-show construct, it makes very little sense now," explains Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman.
